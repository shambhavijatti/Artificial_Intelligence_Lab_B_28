# Introduction to A* Search Algorithm

- A* Search is one of the most widely used informed search algorithms. 

- It combines the strengths of both uniform-cost search and Greedy Best-First Search by using a composite cost function **f(n)=g(n)+h(n)**

where

**g(n)** : **g(n)** is the exact cost from the start node to node n.

**h(n)** : **h(n)** is the heuristic estimate of the cost from n to the goal.
